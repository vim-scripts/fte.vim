==============================================================================
							*fte-overview*
Overview:~
Pompous name and intent aside, this is ment to be the end all template
expansion system for VIM (v6.0 and above)

In my mind VIM lacks very few things. A Template method being one of them,
this is an attempt to remady that.

Feral, Wed Oct 16 PDT 2002

By copious use of comments, checkbox lines and raidobutton banks you can get a
pretty good api assistant type thing with this as well. [Feral:291/02@22:35]

[Feral:303/02@10:03] Note: you know, vts (vim template system) is probably a
better name

==============================================================================
							*fte-stage1* *fte-1*
Stage 1:~
	Enter the template construct into the file.
	(what constitues a template will be discused below)

This can be acomplished via DrChip's CStubs, a :read, a :put, a iabbr ... ANY
method you like to insert text.

This is ment to be the most flexable stage. You can insert the template how
YOU want to insert the template.

My prefered method is DrChip's CStubs to do a :read .. this allows me to
memset` and get my template which is easy to change and update on the fly. I
also use the CodeFrag menu entries fairly often.

NOTE: the codefrag menu.vim needs documented and stuff. -- it is separate
however and should not be documented here.... It's optional! :)
TODO list the vimscript# of codefragments_menu.vim

See also |fte-flt| |fte-flti| below.

==============================================================================
							*fte-stage2* *fte-2*
Stage 2:~
	Fill in the template, depending on the template this can be optional.

The premise is that the template should provide as much infomation as you
could get with a GUI dialog (documtation, checkboxes, raido boxes, edit
fields, etc.) Or, just simplify the creation of a complex code construct

HINT: use a mark/got mark method for easy navagation for your templates

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							*fte-documtation*
	Documtation~
Documtation is provided by lines starting with 'FTE:' being removed during
template expansion |fte-stage3|. This is VERY similar to how a CVS commit
works and is indeed where the idea came from.
Example:~
>
	FTE:This text is a comment.
	FTE: as is this text..
	FTE: As much as you want with whatever information you want.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								*fte-checkbox*
	Checkboxes~

Checkboxes are acomplished via specially formated 'FTE:[ ]<register>:<text>'
lines, where <register> is a normal VIM register [a-zA-Z] and <text> is the
text you want to place into <register> if the checkbox is on.  Uppercase
registers are just as in VIM, they append <text> to the specified register.

If the checkbox is off (whitespace between the brackets) then the line is
treated the same as documtation, it does nothing, is not processed and is
deleted when the template is expanded.


NOTE: Any non whitespace char is supported to denote an on checkbox, 'X' is
used as default.

Example-ON:~
>
	FTE:[X]a:text
This would place "text" into register a

Example-OFF:~
>
	FTE:[ ]a:text
While this would do nothing and is considered a comment and removed.

Example:~
>
	FTE:[X]A:text
This would APPEND "text" to register a
>
	FTE:[ ]A:text
While this is treated as a comment as it is off.


To ease toggling the checkbox line on and off a function is provided
|Feral_TogglePromptLine()| and is mapped (with NO grace currently to
<leader><F4>)


NOTE: currently the register is dirtied, what is put into the register during
|fte-stage3| is left in the register. This is by design to allow faster
template entry. You can preserve register contents with a SaveRegs line, see
something (TODO COMBAK, but for a quickie, place the following FTE:SaveRegs:
line in your template near the top, think it needs to be near the top anyway.)
>
	FTE:SaveRegs:


Example:~

You can use a specific register for the class name in multiple templates. This
allows for the user to toggle the line off vs reentering the class name again.
This results in fewer keystrokes, although would seem to be error prone.

NOTE: Mayhaps there is a better way to go about this. Works well enough
though, I use e,r,t, d,f,g, and c,v,b for tempalte registers.

[Feral:138/03@19:24] By the by I ocasionally wonder if this is a design flaw.
Eventually I'd like to make a preferance flag that makes saving regs the
default and introduce a FTE:DirtyRegs: type flag line to force dirtying.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							*fte-raidobuttons*
	Raidobuttons~

Raidobuttons are accomplished in a way similar to checkboxes, save they
require a raidobuttonbank which is denoted by 'FTE:RAIDO_PROMPT_START' at the
start of a line to start the bank, and 'FTE:RAIDO_PROMPT_END' at the start of
a line to end the bank.

Example:~
>
	FTE: Which sprintf do you actually want?
	FTE:RAIDO_PROMPT_START
	FTE:( )b:_stprintf
	FTE:(*)b:sprintf
	FTE:( )b:sprintf
	FTE:( )b:swprintf
	FTE:RAIDO_PROMPT_END

The provided |Feral_TogglePromptLine()| function transparently handles these
raidobutton banks and properly only allows one entry to be on.

NOTE That it is valid to have comment lines in the raido button bank. I.e.
Example:~
>
	FTE: Which sprintf do you actually want?
	FTE:RAIDO_PROMPT_START
	FTE: TChar
	FTE:( )b:_stprintf
	FTE: normal
	FTE:(*)b:sprintf
	FTE:duh another normal? pointless
	FTE:( )b:sprintf
	FTE: wide
	FTE:( )b:swprintf
	FTE:RAIDO_PROMPT_END
Works fine, but tends to be a pain to toggle the checkbox lines. (coloring is
needed!)

An easier way is to use checkbox comments, described in
|fte-checkbox-comments|.
Example:~
>
	FTE: Which sprintf do you actually want?
	FTE:RAIDO_PROMPT_START
	FTE:( )b:_stprintf		FTE: TChar
	FTE:(*)b:sprintf		FTE: normal
	FTE:( )b:sprintf		FTE:duh another normal? pointless
	FTE:( )b:swprintf		FTE: wide
	FTE:RAIDO_PROMPT_END


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							*fte-checkbox-comments*
	Checkbox comments~

To facilitate commenting checkboxes and in particular raido button banks one
can place '<One_Or_More_WhiteSpace>FTE: comment text' after the text to
provide documtation. Note that the whitespace (<Space> and <Tab> see: |/\s|)
leading up to the second FTE: are eaten, if this causes problems don't use
these inline comments place the comments after or before your checkbox.

Example:~
>
	FTE:[X]b:_stprintf		FTE: TCHAR.H routine
This would place "_stprintf" into register b


Example: (Illistration of limitation)~
If you want to include trailing spaces/tabs in the text you will need to place
your comments after or before the checkbox line as a normal comment (^FTE:
your comment text). I.e.
>
	FTE:[X]b:I want this trailing space!  		FTE: Trailing spaces wil be eaten!
This would place "I want this trailing space!" into register b
>
	FTE: As I want the trailing spaces the comment must go on this line.
	FTE:[X]b:I want this trailing space!  

This would place "I want this trailing space!  " into register b

NOTE: '\s\+FTE:.*$' Is the pattern that matches the comment.


==============================================================================
						*fte-stage3* *fte-3* *:FTE*
Stage 3: ~
	Template Expansion


Templates are expanded by executing the command :FTE with a line range,
defaulting to the current line (which will only process templates in the
current line)

To ease finding the line range a function is provided to Find the temaplte and
execute :FTE on that line range; This function relies on special markers much
like the raido button bank markers, to start a template. The start marker is
'FTE: --------------------- SO: feral-template pass 1 ---------------------'
and the end marker is:
'FTE: --------------------- EO: feral-template pass 1 ---------------------'

NOTE: I wonder if it is actually pass one heh. [Feral:289/02@02:13]
[Feral:291/02@22:01] It is placed in stage one so yes.

Using this method one does not have to worry about line ranges as the
|FeralFindAndExpandTemplate()| command will find (via searching backwards for
the start marker then searching forwards from that point for the end marker)
and execute :FTE on the template range.

Note however you can still select your range (manually or some other command)
and invoke :FTE manually. (if you want to process a sub portion of the
template for instance)

NOTE: [Feral:291/02@22:12] DEV: Another possible method of this would be the
start and end are denoted by lines that do not start with FTE: Possibly that
would be better, less confusing. THen again the current long lines separate
the template from the surrounding code pretty well, which is good. Comments
welcome of course.

NOTE There is no command for FeralFindAndExpandTemplate(), there should be.
TODO call is FTEF or FFT or FTEFE or well something. (=


==============================================================================
*Feral_TogglePromptLine()*

Handles single line and raido bank lines.

Simply toggles a check box line on or off, or a raido bank.

NOTE: There is no command for this.. there should be. TODO Call it :FTETP


==============================================================================
*FeralFindAndExpandTemplate()*

command will find and execute :FTE on the found template range, denoted by:

The start marker:
'FTE: --------------------- SO: feral-template pass 1 ---------------------'
and the end marker:
'FTE: --------------------- EO: feral-template pass 1 ---------------------'

NOTE these must be placed at the start of line, no indenting is allowed and
the single quotes are only for example.

Example #4 from the |fte-example-template-file| section.~
FTE: --------------------- SO: feral-template pass 1 ---------------------
FTE:[X]e:«Var Name?»		FTE: Pointer to destination.
memset(«@e», 0, sizeof(«@e»));
FTE: --------------------- EO: feral-template pass 1 ---------------------


==============================================================================
							*fte-flt* *fte-flti*

These are commands to load a template and place the template marker lines
automatically.


Think of :FLT as :read for templates. :FLTI is used for indenting the non FTE:
lines of the read template (see below). Both :FLT and :FLTI support file name
completion.

NOTE that FLTI is deprecated. don't get partial to it at this time
(unless you say you like it that is ;) ) Instead, in your templates use:
>
	FTE:Indent:


Example:~
Given:
>
	:FLT ~/codefrags/memset.cpp

Results in: (basicaly)
>
	FTE: --------------------- SO: feral-template pass 1 ---------------------
	:read ~/codefrags/memset.cpp
	FTE: --------------------- EO: feral-template pass 1 ---------------------

As mentioned above, :FLTI is :FLT with indent support. This is usefull in any
situation where you want to specify the indent (which is actually just a
string prepending to lines NOT containing ^FTE: IN the loaded file. I.e. adds
spaces to the code you are trying to insert. The indent string is the LAST
string of the :FLTI command line. (i.e. last <f-args> param)

This is deprecated:~
Instead, in your templates use:
>
	FTE:Indent:


Example:~
Given:
>
	:FLTI ~/codefrags/memset.cpp \t

Results in: (basicaly)
>
	FTE: --------------------- SO: feral-template pass 1 ---------------------
	:read ~/codefrags/memset.cpp
	FTE: --------------------- EO: feral-template pass 1 ---------------------
An the non FTE: lines that are read will have "\t" inserted at ^ (start of
line)


Example:~
:FLT
>
	:FLT ~/code frags/memset.cpp
:FLTI
>
	:FLTI ~/code frags/memset.cpp \t


==============================================================================
							*fte-template-flags*

There are currently two flags that specify how FTE should operate for this
template.

Details:~
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Indent (via normal! == for each line) the template? (If not present then no
indenting is done)
>
	FTE:Indent:
i.e.~
>
	TODO

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Save register contents? (if not present specified (in checkbox/raido banks)
registers are overwritten)
>
	FTE:saveregs:
i.e.~
>
	TODO

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO some form of (.vimrc) default option for this;


==============================================================================
							*fte-template-expressions*

There are two ways to evaluate and execute script code, both directly inspired
by Luc's version of mu-template.

Details:~
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE Directly inspred Luc's version of mu-template.
>
	¡expression to evaluate and insert as text¡
i.e.~
>
	TODO

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE Directly inspred Luc's version of mu-template.
>
	¿expression to execute¿
	«:expression to execute»
i.e.~
>
	TODO


==============================================================================
							*fte-template-markers*

NOTE: You can use whatever marker method (jump to a location) you like. (my
examples use a «my text» method, do not confuse this with the template
markers which will be expanded during template expansion |fte-stage3|

NOTE I am open to suggestions on how these should look. The existing methods
mu-template and the like were considered but deamed too hard to type or some
such. Thought ¿FILE¿ does not seem all that hard. ¡FILE¡ WOuld templates like
the previous cause problems with spanish writing people? (are there other
languages that use ¡ and ¿ ?) Again, I'm open to suggestions here.
[Feral:291/02@22:24]

Valid template markers are: (quick ref)~
>
	«CURSOR»			|fte-«CURSOR»|
	«FILE»				|fte-«FILE»|

	«CURSOR»

Places the cursor at this location, the «CURSOR» marker is removed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*fte-«FILE»*

						*fte-howto-apiassistant*

How to use this as an api-assistant:~

Using this as an api assistant (to help you fill in params of api functions)
is basicaly built in. Just comment your template file well and provide some
examples, the |fte-example-template-file| is a prime example.


==============================================================================
							*fte-howto-drchip*

Example from my copy of DrChip's CStubs:~
>
	"mems[et]
	elseif match(wrd, '\c\<mems\%[et]\>') > -1
		let Word_Line = line(".")
		exe "norm! diw"
		execute ":FLTI ~/codefrags/crt/memset-crt.cpp ".escape(getline("."), " \t")
		exe "normal! ".Word_Line."Gdd``"
		unlet Word_Line


NOTE: This needs to be cleaner... At least a little bit!
